          <p>
            The 5 zero waste principles guide us to work toward a more
            sustainable and eco-friendly future. By following these principles,
            individuals can reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills,
            conserve natural resources, and minimize the impact of waste on the
            planet.

              <span class="principle">refuse</span>, is to

              by declining items we don't need, choosing sustainable
              alternatives, and being mindful of purchases.

              repurposing everyday items, repairing instead of replacing, and
              choosing second-hand goods.

              We can do so by properly sorting our recyclables, understanding
              local recycling guidelines, and purchasing items made from
              recycled content.

              composting food scraps and other biodegradable materials at home

            Patagonia'goal is to significantly cut its emissions while

            workers and clients to lead more sustainable lives.

          <h3>Patagonia's history</h3>
          <p>
            Patagonia's sustainability commitment dates back to 1973 when the
            company was founded, even before the concept of sustainability
            emerged, with a vision of a business that doesn't harm the
            environment. Since then, they've been actively working to minimize
            their environmental impact.

              products from wear and tear to them for repairs instead of buying
              a new item, resulting in
              <em>reduced consumption.</em>

              Given the high cost of sending waste to other municipalities, the
              small town pledged in 2003 to reduce its waste instead, becoming
              Japan’s first town to commit to achieving zero waste – a goal that
              seeks to prevent, reduce, reuse, and recycle waste, as well as
              adhere to sustainable manufacturing processes.

              Education: the Kamikatsu-based non-governmental organisation
              (NGO), Zero Waste Academy, was established to promote the concept
              of zero-waste.
